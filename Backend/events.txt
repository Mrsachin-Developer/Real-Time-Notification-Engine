------------------------------------------------



2️⃣ Event Envelope (Universal Structure)
-------------------------------------------
Every event — no matter what type — follows the same shape.

This is called an event envelope.

Event Envelope Fields
Field	    Why It Exists
------------------------------
eventId	    Prevent duplicates
eventType	What happened
timestamp	When it happened
version	    Future-proofing
actor	    Who triggered it
source	    Which service
data	    Event-specific info


---------------------------------
3️⃣ Priority Levels (System Thinking)

Not all events are equal.

Priority Classes

Level	    Meaning	            Example
-----------------------------------------
CRITICAL	Must notify	        POLL.CLOSED
NORMAL	    Good to notify	    POLL.CREATED
LOW	        Analytics only	    POLL.VOTE_CAST
